  <h1>About Me</h1>


<p>

  I am 27 years old, and I live in Winnipeg (the coldest city on earth, I swear.) I am passionate about health and 
  fitness, I love to read, write poetry, and spend time with friends and family. I am also very passionate about learning web development!
  I have recently started to dabble in photography as well, and I'm currently working on a project that allows me to showcase
  some of my photography alongside a few pieces I've written.

  Some of the things that I love about web development are the challanges that it poses, as well as the opportunity to create
  something. I've always loved anything that allows me to bring my ideas to life, and I think the ability to share that with other people
  is pretty cool too.
